# Introduction

Leidokos-Python can be used to prototype new or to test existing functionality, e.g. as part of a regression-testing framework.

Python wrapper code is generated for the main firmware as well as for plugins that explicitly support Python code export. The virtual firmware can be loaded as a Python module.

The project aims to support all portable features of the firmware to make it possible to develop new plugins in a rapid and painless way before finally porting them to C++. Sometimes implementations are the only way to test weird ideas and new algorithms. Leidokos-Python helps by allowing to test such new features under reproducible lab conditions.

## About this document

Leidokos-Python is an open source project whose documentation is and will be a work in progress. If you find any errors or sections that might be improved, please don't hesitate to generate an issue or pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/CapeLeidokos/Leidokos-Python).

## CapeLeidokos

Leidokos-Python is an essential part of the CapeLeidokos build, develop and testing infrastructure for the Kaleidoscope firmware.

## Example usage

For the impatient let's start with a usage example.

Below you see the python code of the example `examples/test_kaleidoscope.py` that is provided as part of the project source repository. It tests some functionality of the firmware.

```python
import kaleidoscope
from kaleidoscope import *
from leidokos import *

driver = TestDriver()
driver.debug = True

# The assertions are evaluated in the next loop cycle
#
driver.queueGroupedReportAssertions([
      ReportNthInCycle(1),
      ReportNthCycle(1),
      ReportKeyActive(keyA()),
      ReportKeyActive(keyB()),
      ReportModifierActive(modSHIFT_HELD()),
      DumpReport()
   ])

driver.keyDown(2, 1)
driver.scanCycle()
driver.keyUp(2, 1)
driver.scanCycles(2)
driver.skipTime(200)
```

Although this might sound strange, tests are there to (potentially) fail. A test that fails helps you to fix an issue in your software. You will rarely look at the output of tests that pass, but if a test fails you certainly want to know what exactly went wrong. That's why it is so important that the information provided by a regression system is more than just to inform that a specific test failed.

To demonstrate what Leidokos-Python outputs when a test fails, this example is deliberately build to fail.

It's console output (stdout) is the following.

# A virtual keyboard

A keyboard firmware is basically a program that consists of an endless loop that reacts in real time on user input.

The real time aspect is essential for an input device. It can makes it very difficult to reproduce failure scenarios. To debug or test certain aspects of a firmware the timing of input is very important. On a real hardware it can sometimes even be necessary to hit several keys in a well defined order and with a well defined timing to trigger a specific behavior. This can in some cases require supernatural skills or at least those of a professional pianist.

This is where Leidokos-Python comes in quite handy.

## Reproducible key sequences

Leidokos-Python enables an exact and reproducible simulation of the firmware input in terms of key-action sequences (presses and releases) with precise timing. Once setup, a sequence can be repeated as often as necessary while debugging and optimizing the firmware code.

## Timing & scan cycles

One loop cycle of the main keyboard firmware loop is called a scan cycle. In every cycle the current state of the keyboard matrix is checked for changes. Specific events are triggered by by calling hook functions that can be defined as part of plugins or the firmware core.

A keyboard scan cycle of the real keyboard has a specific duration, typically in the order of a low number of milliseconds. Typically, between two key-actions, a number of scan cycles elapse. Therefore, the number of scan cycles that elapse is a natural meassure that is required to be sepecified when defining virtual firmware runs.

Apart from elapsing scan cycles, Leidokos-Python allows to specify amounts of time that elapse between consecutive key-actions. The latter requires an estimate of the duration of a single scan cycle's executing on the real hardware. Leidokos-Python automatically computes the number of cycles that match a given time interval.

## Runtime assertions

Commonly, as a reaction on key-actions, the firmware generates USB HID reports that are send to the host computer. These reports are the firmware's output data.

To verify correct behavior of the firmware, it is important to carefully observe the firmware's I/O behavior. As part of its Python API, Leidokos-Python provides a large set of runtime assertions that can be used to define exactly what output is expected as a reaction on specific key-events. Assertions are grouped in report assertions and process assertions.

## Report assertions

A report assertion verifies specific properties of a key report. It e.g. requires that a report must contain a specific key or modifier or that it must not contain one of those. Any combinations of positive or negative assertions are possible. Report assertions can be grouped and are queued. Whenever a report is generated by the keyboard firmware, the next group of assertions is taken form a global queue, casted on the report and then discarded. If assertions fail, errors are reported.

## Process assertions

Process assertions ensure correct timing. A process assertion can e.g. ensure that a given number of HID reports have been generated between two control points of as test run.

## Seamless interaction between Python and C++

Leidokos-Python allows the firmware and all of its plugins to make symbols (functions and variables) available to Python. This means that you can actually call C++ firmware functions from the Python side. This can be very valuable when writing tests to assert specific properties or to control the firmware state but also to play with the firmware without touching the C++ code. Staying on the Python side can allow for much faster development cycles.

## Virtual plugins

Most of the functions and some of the global variables defined by Kaleidoscope's firmware core are exported to Python as part of Leidokos-Pythons standard API. This enables an implementation of whole plugins written in Python and, thus, virtual prototyping. As most programmers will agree, it is much faster to develop new algorithms in Python than it is in C++. This is mainly due to the absence of a compile stage. With Leidokos-Python is is, moreover, due to the absence of firmware device upload.

## Test driven development

You have a new fancy firmware idea and want to write a Kaleidoscope plugin to realize it. Why not use test driven development? The following process can drastically shorten development times.

1.	Define a set of tests with Leidokos-Python.
2.	Develop the plugin's algorithm by writing Python code.
3.	Run the virtual firmware and debug your Python plugin until all your tests pass.
4.	Port the plugin's Python code to C++.
5.	Run the test series again with the C++ version of the new plugin.
6.	Upload and test on the real hardware.
7.	Use and maintain the already existing tests for regression testing with [Leidokos-Testing](https://github.com/CapeLeidokos/Leidokos-Testing).

## Debugging

Most people develop firmware in change-compile-upload-test cycles. In such a scenario, the only way to debug is passing back `printf`-type output to the host system or to use other types of feedback, like LEDs signals or sounds to report the state of the device. This can help in some cases, but how to debug segmentation faults?

On the other hand, using Leidokos-Python with a debugger is very simple. Just run the whole Python process in your favorite debugger. This allows you to debug the firmware code as if it was an ordinary host program. Leidokos-Python's programmable tests thereby enable an exact reproducibility of errors.

## LED and keymap visualization

Apart from USB HID reports, there are other things that might happen as a reaction on key-actions. A keyboard of course has its own state. Parts of this state are more or less visible. Some keyboards are equipped with per-key LEDs. It is, thus, important to visualize the state of the LED matrix of the virtual keyboard.

Another thing that is usually not displayed but would be very nice to be displayed is the currently active keymap, i.e. the keys' current meaning. This is a point where a virtual keyboard has a clear advantage as it is fairly simple to display the current keymap for debugging purposes.

`examples/Kaleidoscope-Heatmap` demonstrates how the virtual keymap and LED visualization may be used to visualize a keyboard heatmap. First an example text is typed on the virtual keyboard. Then, the resulting heatmap that is generated by plugin `Kaleidoscope-Heatmap` is visualized.

# Usage

Leidokos-Python's build process of the virtual Kaleidoscope firmware is a two stage process (stages 1 and 2 below). First you configure the CMake build system, then you build (compile and link) the firmware. The CMake build system must be configured only once. Later, when developing and performing change-test cycles, only the build stage needs to be repeated.

The following explanation of the Python module build assumes that the firmwares source code has already been downloaded to a directory `<sketchbook_dir>`, as described in the [Kaleidoscope Wiki](https://github.com/keyboardio/Kaleidoscope/wiki/Keyboardio-Model-01-Introduction).

The example shell commands below work on GNU/Linux and MacOS.

1. Configure the CMake build system

   Configuration of the build system is only carried out once. Later you will only repeat the build process while developing.

   The CMake configuration process automatically detects Boost Python and a Python installation and prepares all plugins that reside in one or more directories that are specified through the CMake variable `KALEIDOSCOPE_HARDWARE_BASE_PATH`. It also prepares the overall build system by generating symbolic links in specific places. The latter is necessary to allow for builds that can run on the host system (x86) rather than the keyboard.

    ```bash
    # Set some auxiliary variables that will be used later on.
    #
    SKETCHBOOK_DIR=<sketchbook_dir>
    BUILD_DIR=<build_dir>

    # Clone Leidokos-Python to your firmware boards directory.
    #
    cd $SKETCHBOOK_DIR/hardware/keyboardio/avr/libraries
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/CapeLeidokos/Leidokos-Python.git

    # Run the CMake configuration process.
    #
    cd ${BUILD_DIR}
    cmake \
       -DKALEIDOSCOPE_FIRMWARE_SKETCH=$SKETCHBOOK_DIR/hardware/keyboardio/avr/libraries/Model01-Firmware/Model01-Firmware.ino \
       $SKETCHBOOK_DIR/hardware/keyboardio/avr/libraries/Leidokos-Python
    ```

2. Build the Firmware

   Build the firmware as described for [Leidokos-CMake](https://github.com/CapeLeidokos/Leidokos-CMake.git), on a GNU/Linux or MacOS system e.g. run

   ```bash
   make
   ```

   This will create a library `kaleidoscope.so` (GNU/Linux and MacOS) or `kaleidoscope.dll` (Windows) in the build directory. The shared library (dll) that is created will be loaded as a Python module during you tests.

3. Run a virtual firmware

    ```bash
    # Tell Python where to find the newly build module and some auxiliary modules
    # that come with Leidokos-Python.
    #
    export PYTHONPATH=$BUILD_DIR:$SKETCHBOOK_DIR/hardware/keyboardio/avr/libraries/Leidokos-Python/python:$PYTHONPATH

    # Run the Python test.
    #
    python3 $SKETCHBOOK_DIR/hardware/keyboardio/avr/libraries/Leidokos-Python/examples/test_kaleidoscope.py
    ```

# Under the hood

This plugin depends on the [Kaleidoscope-Hardware-Virtual](https://github.com/cdisselkoen/Kaleidoscope-Hardware-Virtual) plugin to build a shared library that can be loaded as a Python module on the host system (x86). Its build process is too complex to be entirely incorporated in the Arduino build system. Therefore, to automatize largest parts of the build process, the plugin relies on[CMake](https://cmake.org/) as a first level build system that prepares the actual build as part of the Arduino build system.

A two step build process consists in running CMake to prepare the plugin's build system and that of all modules that request the generation of Python wrappers. In a second step, the Arduino build system of the overall sketch is executed that creates the loadable Python module that makes all those modules accessible to Python that have specified directives for wrapper generation, see more about this below.

# Prerequisites

Leidokos-Python depends on a number of external software projects to build and run firmware. The installation process greatly differs between platforms and OS flavors.

It is not possible for Leidokos-Python's maintainers to support all sorts of platforms. Build instructions might change over time. Whenever you find that the instructions in this document are out of date, please open an [issue or submit a pull request](https://github.com/CapeLeidokos/Leidokos-Python).

## GUN/Linux

Python wrapping depends on [boost Python](http://www.boost.org) to auto-generate Python wrapper code for C++ classes, functions and global data. Apart from that, CMake is needed to setup the plugin's build system.

On Ubuntu Linux, the necessary packages can be installed as

```bash
sudo apt-get install libboost-python-dev cmake python3-dev
```

To configure the CMake build system manually, most Linux distributions allow for a curses based CMake GUI to be installed. Install it as follows under Ubuntu Linux.

```bash
sudo apt-get install cmake-curses-gui
```

This is how to execute the CMake GUI.

```bash
cd <sketchbook_dir>/hardware/keyboardio/avr/libraries/Leidokos-Python
ccmake .
```

For the generation of the Python API generation, you will have to install[http://www.sphinx-doc.org](Sphinx), under Ubuntu Linux e.g. as

```bash
sudo apt-get install python-sphinx
```

## MacOS

Prerequisites can be installed using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

```bash
brew install ccache
brew upgrade python
brew install boost-python --with-python3 --without-python
sudo -H pip3 install pyyaml
sudo -H pip3 install sphinx
```

## Windows

Currently there is no official Windows support. All required prerequisites are available for Windows, we just haven't found time to come up with build instructions.

If you find a way to use Leidokos-Python with Windows, please let us know by submitting an [issue or a pull request](https://github.com/CapeLeidokos/Leidokos-Python).

# CMake build setup configuration

The CMake based setup of the plugin's Arduino build relies on a number of variables that allow detailed configuration. For an explanation of such variables, run `ccmake .` as described above. Then look for build variables whose name starts with `KALEIDOSCOPE_`. A documentation of a variable is shown when the cursor is moved to the variable's line.

Although, Leidokos-Python is meant to be as auto-detecting and smart as possible, it may be necessary to configure the system.

| CMake Variable                      | Purpose                                                                                                                 |

| KALEIDOSCOPE_ARDUINO_SKETCHBOOK_DIR | A path to an Arduino sketchbook.                                                                                        |
| LEIDOKOS_PYTHON_GENERATE_API_DOC    | Enable this flag to generate the Python API documentation                                                               |

Other CMake build system variables are defined by [Leidokos-CMake](https://github.com/CapeLeidokos/Leidokos-CMake.git) and documented there.

# Python module usage

Leidokos-Python provides a Python API that makes the generation of Kaleidoscope firmware tests pretty simple.

The API lives in a python module `leidokos` that can be found in the `python` directory of the Leidokos-Python repository.

Examples that exemplify the use of the testing API can be found in the `examples` directory of this project.

For Python to find the generated firmware module and the the `leidokos` module. Both files' paths must be made known to Python via the environment variable `PYTHONPATH`, e.g. as

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=<path to kaleidoscope dynamic library>:<Leidokos-Python repo path>/python:$PYTHONPATH
```

You can then run one of the examples or your own python test script, e.g.

```bash
PYTHON3_EXECUTABLE=<path_to_your_python_3_executable>/python3
LEIDOKOS_PYTHON_REPOSITORY=<Leidokos_Python_repo_path>

$PYTHON3_EXECUTABLE $LEIDOKOS_PYTHON_REPOSITORY/examples/test_kaleidoscope.py
```

# Python API documentation

HTML based documentation of the Python API supplied by Leidokos-Python can be auto-generated through the CMake `doc` target. Please see the Prerequisites section of this documentation for information about additional third party software that needs to be installed on you platform to generate the API documentation.

Configure the build system as explained above but add the flag

```bash
cmake ... \
   -DLEIDOKOS_PYTHON_GENERATE_API_DOC=TRUE
```

*Note:* You can also enable the variable `LEIDOKOS_PYTHON_GENERATE_API_DOC` from the CMake curses GUI (ccmake) or other CMake GUIs.

Then build the API documentation. When the GNU Makefile generator is used (the default under Linux), this can e.g. be done as follows.

```bash
make doc
```

The documentation is generated in the `doc/kaleidoscope/API` directory of the build tree. Open the file `kaleidoscope_testing.html` in a browser to see the API documentation.

# Python export

Leidokos-Python allows any Kaleidoscope components to export classes, functions and data to be accessible from Python scripts. The easiest way for this to work is to add a file named `<your_module_name>.python-wrapper` to the`src` directory of any Kaleidoscope module that is meant to export symbols to python language.

The `.python-wrapper` are actually C++ files. We use a different file extension to prevent them to be considered in any normal firmware builds that are not targeted to the host system (x86). To make them accessible for the Python wrapper build, the plugin's CMake system searches for `.python-wrapper` files in directories below paths that are specified in `KALEIDOSCOPE_MODULE_REPO_PATHS`. For all files found, symbolic links with extension `.cpp` are generated to allow the python wrapper files to be found during the actual firmware build.

An example `.python-wrapper` file that exports the `MouseKeys_` class of plugin *Kaleidoscope-MouseKeys* might look the following way. See the [documentation of boost-Python](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_58_0/libs/Python/doc/index.html) for more information.

**Important:** The Kaleidoscope-MouseKeys plugin may have changed after this document was written. This example simply demonstrates how an export for a plugin might look.

For a real example have a look on the `testing/example_test` directory of CapeLeidokos' fork of [Kaleidoscope-OneShot](https://github.com/CapeLeidokos/Kaleidoscope-OneShot/tree/feature/python_export) which is a demo regression system setup. Also have a look at the project's `.travis.yml` file to see how Leidokos-Testing is used for regression testing.

```cpp
